    summary: FTL Form Submission
    description: Allows clients to submit a Full Truck Load (FTL) form without needing to register or sign up. The form captures essential details required for FTL services. If email already exists then map this form to that account if not then create a new account based on email user provides in the form.
                **Validation Warning (Conditional Fields):** This form uses complex validation logic. Certain fields become mandatory based on the values chosen in other fields (e.g., if 'transportMode' is 'road', 'truckSize' is required). The schema uses 'if/then' logic for automatic validation.

    summary: Packers & Movers Form Submission
    description: >
      Allows clients to submit a Packers & Movers service request without
      requiring prior registration or sign-up. The form captures personal
      details, pickup and dropoff addresses, shifting date and time, list of
      items to be moved, optional insurance requirement, and reference images.

      If the email already exists, the request is mapped to the existing user
      account. If the email does not exist, a new user account is created based
      on the provided email.

      **Validation Warning:**  
      This form uses mixed validation logic. Some fields are mandatory
      (e.g., name, phone, pickup/dropoff address, pickup date, items), while
      others are optional (e.g., email, insurance, images, notes).
      The `items` field is expected as a JSON-stringified array when submitted
      via `multipart/form-data`.
