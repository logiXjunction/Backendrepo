    summary: FTL Form Submission
    description: Allows clients to submit a Full Truck Load (FTL) form without needing to register or sign up. The form captures essential details required for FTL services. If email already exists then map this form to that account if not then create a new account based on email user provides in the form.
                **Validation Warning (Conditional Fields):** This form uses complex validation logic. Certain fields become mandatory based on the values chosen in other fields (e.g., if 'transportMode' is 'road', 'truckSize' is required). The schema uses 'if/then' logic for automatic validation.
